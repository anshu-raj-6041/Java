// Principle of Object-Oriented Programming
// 1> Abstraction (hiding internal details and showing only req features)
// 2> Encapsulation 
// 3> Inheritance (Specialization) => copy as it is but add some new features
// 4> Polymorphism (Generalization) => refer set of things under 1 name(TV, Car)

// Class(design) vs Object
// Object can be defined using 1>Properties(variable) 2>Behaviour(Methods)

// To use getter and setter, we have to make property as private
